A project can be managed only by a manager , and the tasks can be managed by the Developer .
I used a gantt graph using **AnyChart** to see the developement of a project and its tasks.
A developer can't update other developers tasks.

# Internship at EXPERTISE DATA , Morocco-Casablanca
i worked as Data Analyst , and used Power BI to create my report and analysis. 

Since as intern they can't give you the data , i used a public Dataset and worked on 

This Analysis is certified by DataCamp : https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/4dbac83d8ef30ade9a2990dac12654810df584c1

Dataset is from Databel, a company suffering from customer churn , so to understand why the customers are churning , i m gonna analyse the Dataset .


### Datacheck
Before starting my analysis , i checked if there errors or Empty values , and as we can see our data is valid .

### Transform Data

To make our data simple to run , we transformed some columns to make it easier for queries to read it
Here we transformed Churned Column from 'Yes' 'No' to '1' '0'
