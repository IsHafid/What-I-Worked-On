A project can be managed only by a manager , and the tasks can be managed by the Developer .
I used a gantt graph using **AnyChart** to see the developement of a project and its tasks.
A developer can't update other developers tasks.

# Internship at EXPERTISE DATA , Morocco-Casablanca
i worked as Data Analyst , and used Power BI to create my report and analysis. 

Since as intern they can't give you the data , i used a public Dataset and worked on 

This Analysis is certified by DataCamp : https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/4dbac83d8ef30ade9a2990dac12654810df584c1

Dataset is from Databel, a company suffering from customer churn , so to understand why the customers are churning , i m gonna analyse the Dataset .


### Datacheck
Before starting my analysis , i checked if there errors or Empty values , and as we can see our data is valid .

### Transform Data

To make our data simple to run , we transformed some columns to make it easier for queries to read it
Here we transformed Churned Column from 'Yes' 'No' to '1' '0'

### Categorize the Data
Our Data is so detailed ,so make it simple and easier to analyse , i created new columns with DAX queries to categorize the Data .

![alt text](https://github.com/IsHafid/What-I-Worked-On/blob/main/Expertise%20Data%20Internship%20Churn%20Rate%20Analysis/Categ.PNG)

### Measures

Using DAX , I created measure that will help me in analysis and calculations .

![alt text](https://github.com/IsHafid/What-I-Worked-On/blob/main/Expertise%20Data%20Internship%20Churn%20Rate%20Analysis/Measures.PNG)

### Analysis

**Churn Demographic**
As we can see the majority of the customers that churn are Seniors .

The Churn Rate in Total is 26,86% due to 2 Main Reasons , The Competitor has better offers and devices

![alt text](https://github.com/IsHafid/What-I-Worked-On/blob/main/Expertise%20Data%20Internship%20Churn%20Rate%20Analysis/ChurnDemographic.PNG)

So as solution to Senior Customers Churn , we can make special offers for them to keep the trust with our Senior Client.

**Groups And Categories**

We can see that the main reason for our customer churn is the competitor with 44,82% of the reasons listed as category.

the churn rate is high in the monthly contract with 46,29%. 

![alt text](https://github.com/IsHafid/What-I-Worked-On/blob/main/Expertise%20Data%20Internship%20Churn%20Rate%20Analysis/G_Categories.PNG)

As i said in the first dashboard , we need to make better offers by analyzing our competitor's offers , and to understand why our monthly subscription is working right we gonna analyse it later with more details.

**Unlimited Data Plan**

The highset churn that we have are people who uses unlimited data with less than 5GB and also subscribe/ not subscribers customers that using between 5 and 10GB or more are not satsified with offer.

![alt text](https://github.com/IsHafid/What-I-Worked-On/blob/main/Expertise%20Data%20Internship%20Churn%20Rate%20Analysis/Unlimited_Data.PNG)

so as solution we can make the internet speed much faster and more reliable and make it worth for an unlimited plan.

**International Phone Calls Plan**

We see that 71.19% of the customers who have a Premium international call subscription do not have active international calls, and 40.34% are active but not Premium so we can make an new subscription plan that can make us win the trust of this customers.

![alt text](https://github.com/IsHafid/What-I-Worked-On/blob/main/Expertise%20Data%20Internship%20Churn%20Rate%20Analysis/International%20Calls.PNG)

**Contract Type And Churn**

We can see the longer the subscription the more customers churn for monthly subscription.
we can make monthly rewards for those customers that can make us win their trust each month .
